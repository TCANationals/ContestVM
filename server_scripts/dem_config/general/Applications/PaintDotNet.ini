# This is a custom Flex config file which was generated with VMware DEM Application Profiler.

# DirectFlex is configured and enabled (on the DirectFlex tab) to import personal settings
# when Paint.NET is launched and to export settings when it is closed.

# For demo purposes a predefined setting is configured (on the Predefined Settings tab) to
# disable the 'Ruler' option within Paint.NET each time it is started. Other changes in
# personal settings within Paint.NET will be imported and exported.

# Additionally profile cleanup is configured (on the Profile Cleanup tab) to remove all
# Paint.NET personal settings from the user profile each time an export is successfull,
# keeping the base user profile as small and fast as possible.
