# This is a custom Flex config file which was generated with VMware DEM Application Profiler.

# DirectFlex is configured and enabled (on the DirectFlex tab) to import personal settings
# when VLC media player is launched and to export settings when it is closed.

# Additionally profile cleanup is configured (on the Profile Cleanup tab) to remove all
# VLC media player personal settings from the user profile each time an export is successful,
# keeping the base user profile as small and fast as possible.
